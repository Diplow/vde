# Feature plan: HomePage

## Problem

There is no flow currently to login and start creating your own Map.

## Context

Read those files for a global understanding of the project architecture:

- README.md : a high level presentation of the project
- src/app/map/[id]/README.md : a presentation of the main page of the application and its structure
- src/server/README.md : a presentation of the backend server of the application and its structure
- src/lib/domains/mapping/README.md : a presentation of the mapping domain
- src/lib/auth/README.md : a presentation of the authentication solution used in this project

## High Level Goals

1. Create a signup page that once singned up create your map and redirects you to it.
2. Create a login page that once logged in redirects you to your map.

## Implementation

### Goal 1: Create a signup page that once signed up creates your map and redirects you to it.

1.  **Frontend - Signup Page (`/signup`):**

    - **Routing:** Create a new Next.js page at `src/app/signup/page.tsx`.
    - **UI:**
      - This page should prominently feature the `AuthTile` component (e.g., from `src/app/map/[id]/Tile/auth.dynamic.tsx`, potentially needing to be made more generic or relocated).
      - The `AuthTile` should be configured to show the registration view by default (e.g., via a prop).
      - Style the page for a clean user experience.
    - **Page Logic (in `src/app/signup/page.tsx`):**
      - Render the `AuthTile` component, configured for signup.
      - Implement client-side logic using `useEffect` and `authClient.useSession()` (or `useAuth` from `AuthContext`):
        - If the user is already authenticated on page load, redirect them (e.g., to their map, or the main app page).
        - After a successful signup through `AuthTile` (i.e., user becomes authenticated):
          - Call the tRPC mutation `map.createDefaultMapForCurrentUser`.
          - Upon successful map creation, redirect to `/map/[mapId]`.
          - Handle and display any errors from the tRPC call or redirection.
        - Manage overall page loading states (checking auth, signup process, map creation).

2.  **Backend - tRPC:**

    - **New Mutation (`map.createDefaultMapForCurrentUser`):**
      - Locate this in a relevant mapping router, likely `src/server/api/routers/map.ts` (or similar, based on project structure).
      - This procedure must be a `protectedProcedure` as it requires an authenticated user.
      - **Input:** None (it will use `ctx.user.id` from the session).
      - **Logic:**
        - Check if the user already has a map to prevent duplicates if this flow is somehow re-triggered (optional, depends on desired UX).
        - Use the `mapping` domain service/action (e.g., `CreateMapAction`) to create a new map.
          - The map should be associated with `ctx.user.id`.
          - It can have a default name like "[User's Name]'s Map" or "My First Map".
        - **Output:** Return `{ success: true, mapId: newMap.id }`.
      - Handle potential errors during map creation (e.g., database errors) and return appropriate tRPC errors.

3.  **Domain Logic (`mapping` domain):**

    - Ensure the `CreateMapAction` (or equivalent service/action) in the `src/lib/domains/mapping/` directory correctly assigns `ownerId` when creating a map. This should already be the case if `better-auth` integration updated `hexMaps.ownerId` as per `src/lib/auth/README.md`.

4.  **Navigation/Redirection:**
    - After successful signup and map creation, the user should be seamlessly redirected to their new map.
    - Consider what happens if a user navigates to `/` or other protected routes before having a map (they should ideally be guided to create one, or the signup flow should be the primary entry).

### Goal 2: Create a login page that once logged in redirects you to your map.

1.  **Frontend - Login Page (`/login`):**

    - **Routing:** Create a new Next.js page at `src/app/login/page.tsx`.
    - **UI:**
      - This page should prominently feature the `AuthTile` component (e.g., from `src/app/map/[id]/Tile/auth.dynamic.tsx`).
      - The `AuthTile` should be configured to show the login view by default (e.g., via a prop).
      - Style the page for a clean user experience.
    - **Page Logic (in `src/app/login/page.tsx`):**
      - Render the `AuthTile` component, configured for login.
      - Implement client-side logic using `useEffect` and `authClient.useSession()` (or `useAuth` from `AuthContext`):
        - If the user is already authenticated on page load, redirect them (e.g., to their map, or the main app page).
        - After a successful login through `AuthTile` (i.e., user becomes authenticated):
          - Call the tRPC query `map.getUserMap`.
          - If a map exists, redirect to `/map/[mapId]`.
          - If no map is found, redirect to a "create map" flow (e.g., `/signup` or a specific page as per Option A in previous plan section).
          - Handle and display any errors from the tRPC call or redirection.
        - Manage overall page loading states (checking auth, login process, map data fetching).

2.  **Backend - tRPC:**

    - **New Query (`map.getUserMap`):**
      - Locate this in the mapping router (`src/server/api/routers/map.ts` or similar).
      - This procedure must be a `protectedProcedure`.
      - **Input:** None (uses `ctx.user.id`).
      - **Logic:**
        - Query the database for a map owned by `ctx.user.id`.
        - If multiple maps can exist per user, define logic to select which one to redirect to (e.g., the first one found, the most recently updated, or allow user to choose if this becomes a feature later). For now, assume one primary map.
        - **Output:** Return `{ success: true, map: { id: userMap.id, name: userMap.name } }` or `{ success: true, map: null }` if no map is found.
      - Handle potential errors.

3.  **Navigation/Redirection:**
    - Ensure smooth redirection to the user's map post-login.
    - Update any existing logic that might redirect users (e.g., from a generic homepage or protected routes) to check for authentication and map existence, guiding them to `/login` or `/signup` as appropriate.

### General Considerations:

- **Homepage (`/`):**
  - Decide the behavior of the root path (`/`).
  - If the user is not authenticated, it should ideally present options to "Login" or "Sign Up", redirecting to `/login` or `/signup` respectively.
  - If the user is authenticated:
    - If they have a map, redirect to `/map/[mapId]`.
    - If they don't have a map (e.g., signed up but map creation failed, or an old user before this flow), display an error and tell to contact an administrator.
- **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling for all API calls and user interactions (e.g., network errors, validation errors, server errors).
- **UI/UX:** Ensure a consistent and intuitive user experience across these new pages and flows. Use loading indicators and provide clear feedback to the user.
- **Code Structure:** Keep new pages and components organized within the existing Next.js app structure (`src/app/`).
- **Auth UI Component:** Utilize the `AuthTile` component (e.g., from `src/app/map/[id]/Tile/auth.dynamic.tsx`).
  - It should be configurable (e.g., via props) to default to either the login or registration view.
  - The `AuthContext` (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`) and client-side hooks like `authClient.useSession()` will be essential for the `/login` and `/signup` pages to react to authentication state changes triggered by `AuthTile`.
