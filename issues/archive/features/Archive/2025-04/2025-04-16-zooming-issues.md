# Fixing various issues

## Problems

- [x] When expanding a tile, the new center tile is empty instead of containing the same center tile
- Whatever tile we expand, we should be able to collapse it immediatly back into the previous state
- When zooming, the view does not adjust
- Tile labels too small, and truncated
- Collapse and Extends icons not well colored and too small

- [x] When zooming, the interface becomes way too small
- [x] Show description for the center
- Empty tiles should have a lighter color than the one they will get when created

- [x] When creating a new tile, it is very dark for a moment it should not

- ctrl+z should cancel the last collapse/expand action
- Transitions between expand and collaspe
- Lvl2Tile, Lvl3Tile
- kill the drawer and replace them with a big hex with actions
