# Feature Plan: HexMap Zoom

## 1. Problem Statement

One can see a map with 7 Hex, 1 central and 1 on each sides. One can read a "side hex" as "meaningful context" to understand the central one. But if we want to give extra context "one level deeper", which means creating side hex to side hex, we can not anymore.

## 2. Context

The backend data management is exposed through a tRPC API defined in src/server/api/routers/map (exposed via src/server/api/root) and should not be affected by this "zoom" feature because the hex coordinate system already allow to define neighbor to a "non depth 0 coordinate".

The frontend application is a nextJS application using app router. The page responsible to expose the interface for HexMap display and interaction is the /map/[id] page. This feature is about implementing modification to the state of this page and to the HexBoard component.

## 3. High-Level Goal

Modify the custom hook "useHexMapViewState" to add a zoom level and adapt the HexBoard accordingly. Expose an interface to change this zoom level.

## 4. Implementation

1. Step 1: useHexMapViewState modification

- expose a number data state const `zoomLevel: number`
- expose an event `changeZoomLevel`

2. Step 2: HexBoard modification

- the existing HexBoard is used for zoomLevel 0
- Create the HexBoard for the zoomLevel 1. It concists of 7 HexBoard of zoomLevel 0 except one detail: the center is not `{ row: 0, col: 0, path: []}` but `{ row: 0, col: 0, path: [0]}` and a "side hex" of coordinate `{ row: 0, col: 0, path:[i] }` will become `{ row: 0, col: 0, path: [i, 0] }`
  Guidance: Use the same logic that was used by level 0 and HexTiles with a flex layout but with HexBoard of level 0 instead of HexTiles. It will probably needs some adjustments with margins, but it should work. Also consider that instead of having directions around the center hex be NorthEast, NorthWest, West, SouthWest, SouthEast, East, they become North EastNorth, EastSouth, South, WestSouth, WestNorth
