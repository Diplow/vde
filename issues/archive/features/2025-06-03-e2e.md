# End-to-End Testing Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for end-to-end (E2E) testing in the VDE (Visual Deliberation Environment) project.

## Goals

- [ ] Define E2E testing strategy
- [ ] Choose appropriate testing framework
- [ ] Establish test structure and patterns
- [ ] Create comprehensive test scenarios
- [ ] Setup CI/CD integration

## Ideas & Discussion Points

<!-- We'll capture ideas and discussions here as we go -->

### Testing Philosophy

- **Focus on Happy Path**: Start with core functionalities that users rely on most
  - Reduce maintenance burden
  - Faster execution times
  - Higher ROI on testing effort
- **AI-Friendly Debugging**: Tests should be debuggable by AI assistants (Claude Code)
  - Rich traces beyond stack traces
  - Clear test descriptions and step names
  - Capture screenshots/videos at key points
  - Structured error reporting
- **Progressive Coverage**: Start minimal, expand based on actual bugs/regressions
- **Progressive Enhancement Testing**: Every happy path must be tested in BOTH modes
  - Static mode (JavaScript disabled) - Server-side functionality
  - Dynamic mode (JavaScript enabled) - Full client interactivity
  - Ensures both experiences work correctly
  - Validates our progressive enhancement architecture
  - Each test scenario runs twice with different configurations

### Accessibility Testing Considerations

- **Current Priority**: Not in initial E2E scope, but important for future
- **Best Practices**:
  - **Automated checks**: Playwright's built-in accessibility testing (`@axe-core/playwright`)
  - **Storybook**: Good for component-level a11y testing during development
  - **Manual testing**: Most effective for screen reader experience
- **Recommended Approach**:
  1. Start with basic automated checks in E2E (low effort, catches obvious issues)
  2. Add Storybook a11y addon for component development
  3. Manual screen reader testing for critical flows later
  4. Consider specialized tools (NVDA, JAWS) when a11y becomes priority
- **Quick wins for now**:
  - Ensure semantic HTML in static mode
  - Add basic ARIA labels to interactive elements
  - Test keyboard navigation in E2E tests

### Test Dataset Strategy

- **Dedicated E2E Dataset**: Separate from development/production data
  - Predictable and stable test conditions
  - Grows incrementally with new features
  - Version controlled for reproducibility
- **Dataset Principles**:
  - Start minimal - only data needed for current tests
  - Each test scenario may have specific data requirements
  - Clear naming conventions for test entities
  - Isolated from other test suites (unit, integration)
- **Future Considerations** (to be detailed later):
  - How to create and seed the dataset
  - Maintenance and evolution strategy
  - Handling test data cleanup/reset
  - Potential use of fixtures or factories

### True E2E Testing Philosophy

- **No Mocking**: Tests run against the real, full application stack
  - Real backend server running (Next.js API routes + tRPC)
  - Real database (PostgreSQL test instance)
  - Real authentication flow (Better-Auth)
  - Real network requests
- **Benefits**:
  - Tests actual user experience
  - Catches integration issues between layers
  - Validates full request/response cycle
  - Tests actual performance characteristics
- **Implications**:
  - Need to start backend before tests
  - Database must be seeded with test data
  - Tests may be slower but more reliable
  - Port management for concurrent test runs
- **Rare Exceptions**: Only mock external services (if any) that we don't control

### E2E Test Architecture - Action-Based Approach

- **Action Functions**: High-level abstractions over user interactions
  - Example: `expandTile(coord)` handles hover → find button → click
  - Benefits: Reusable, readable, maintainable
  - Matches how users think about the app
- **Playwright Philosophy**:
  - **Locators over selectors**: Use semantic locators (`getByRole`, `getByText`)
  - **Auto-waiting**: No explicit waits needed, Playwright waits for elements
  - **User-centric**: Test what users see/do, not implementation details
- **Assertion Strategy Options**:
  1. **Explicit checks**: `checkPanelHasOpened()` - More readable, clear intent
  2. **Action-based validation**: Next action fails if state is wrong - More implicit
  3. **Hybrid**: Critical states get explicit checks, others validated by subsequent actions
- **Recommended Pattern**:

  ```typescript
  // High-level actions
  await expandTile({
    userId: 123,
    groupId: 0,
    path: [1, 2], // Array of directions
  });
  await createChildTile("New idea");
  await moveItem(source, target);

  // Explicit assertions for critical states
  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/.*path=1,2/);
  ```

### Testing Framework Choice

- **Playwright** selected for E2E testing
  - Excellent support for progressive enhancement testing (JS on/off)
  - Native TypeScript support
  - Fast parallel execution
  - Network interception for API mocking
  - Cross-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
  - Better than Cypress for SSR/server-side testing
  - More modern than Selenium/WebDriver

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Framework**: Playwright for E2E testing

   - Rationale: Best fit for progressive enhancement architecture, TypeScript-first, modern tooling

2. **Dual-Mode Testing**: Every test runs in both static and dynamic modes

   - Static: JavaScript disabled (tests server-side functionality)
   - Dynamic: JavaScript enabled (tests full client interactivity)
   - Implementation: Use Playwright's `page.setJavaScriptEnabled()` or browser contexts
   - Test structure: Single test definition, parameterized execution

3. **True E2E Testing**: No mocking - full application stack

   - Real backend, database, and authentication
   - Tests actual integration between all layers
   - Higher confidence in real-world behavior

4. **Action-Based Test Architecture**: User-centric action functions
   - High-level functions that mirror user actions
   - Explicit assertions only for critical checkpoints
   - Let subsequent actions validate previous ones implicitly

## Implementation Phases

<!-- We'll structure the implementation approach here -->

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Basic Map Navigation (No Auth Required)

**Description**: Anonymous user explores a public map through expansion/navigation/collapse

**User Journey**:

1. Navigate to `/map/${MAP_ID}`
2. Verify center tile shows user's name/title
3. Expand the center tile (userId at center)
4. Verify child tiles appear with correct titles
5. Expand a child tile
6. Navigate to the child (click to focus)
7. Verify URL updates and child title is visible
8. Expand a child of this child (grandchild)
9. Verify grandchild title
10. Navigate back to center via hierarchy tile click
11. Collapse the grandchild
12. Collapse the center

**Test Coverage**:

- URL-based navigation
- Tile expansion/collapse mechanics
- Focus changes updating URL
- Hierarchy navigation
- State persistence through navigation
- Both static (page refreshes) and dynamic (SPA) modes

**Key Assertions**:

- URL reflects current focus (e.g., `?path=1,2`)
- Expanded state in URL (e.g., `?expanded=128,134,112`)
- Tiles render correctly at each step
- Hierarchy path shows correct navigation trail
- Tile titles are correct at each level (verifies correct data loading)

## Technical Architecture

### Action Functions for Scenario 1

```typescript
// Navigation
async function navigateToMap(mapId: string);
async function navigateToTile(coordinates: TileCoordinates);

// Tile interactions
async function expandTile(coordinates: TileCoordinates);
async function collapseFrame(coordinates: TileCoordinates);
async function clickHierarchyTile(level: number); // 0 = root, 1 = parent, etc.

// Assertions
async function assertFocusedTile(expectedPath: number[]);
async function assertExpandedTiles(expectedPaths: number[][]);
async function assertTileVisible(coordinates: TileCoordinates);
async function assertTileContent(
  coordinates: TileCoordinates,
  expectedText: string,
);
```

### Test Implementation Pattern

```typescript
test.describe("Basic Map Navigation", () => {
  ["static", "dynamic"].forEach((mode) => {
    test(`${mode}: Navigate and explore map tiles`, async ({
      page,
      context,
    }) => {
      // Set JavaScript enabled/disabled based on mode
      if (mode === "static") {
        await context.setJavaScriptEnabled(false);
      }

      // Execute test steps...
    });
  });
});
```
