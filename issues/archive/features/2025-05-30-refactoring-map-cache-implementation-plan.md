# Map Cache Refactoring - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document provides a detailed implementation plan to transform the current map cache implementation into the refined architecture outlined in the refactor plan. The goal is to create a clean, testable, and maintainable cache system with clear separation of concerns.

**IMPORTANT FOR IMPLEMENTATION**: After completing each step, mark the validation criteria as completed by adding an "x" between the square brackets (e.g., `- [x] All action creators are pure functions`). This allows future chats to quickly identify which steps have been completed without needing to investigate the codebase.

## Testing Strategy

**Primary Test Command**:

```bash
npm run test -- src/app/map/\[id\]/Cache
```

**Development Testing**:

```bash
npm run test:watch -- src/app/map/\[id\]/Cache
```

**Coverage Check**:

```bash
npm run test:coverage -- src/app/map/\[id\]/Cache
```

### Testing Principles

- Each step should be tested as early as possible
- Tests should be written before or alongside implementation
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Use mocks for external dependencies to enable isolated testing

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Extract Pure Reducer (Foundation)

**Objective**: Create the core State layer with a pure reducer, actions, and selectors.

**Timeline**: 3-4 steps, estimated 1-2 days

#### Assumptions

- Current reducer logic in `cache-reducer.ts` is mostly pure and can be extracted
- Existing action types can be refined and moved to a dedicated actions file
- State shape remains similar but may need minor adjustments
- We'll maintain backward compatibility during the transition
- No breaking changes to the public cache API

#### Step 1.1: Create State Directory and Actions

**Tasks**:

1. Create `src/app/map/[id]/Cache/State/` directory
2. Extract action types from `map-cache-types.ts` into `State/actions.ts`
3. Add action creators for better type safety
4. Create comprehensive action type definitions
5. Ensure action creators are pure functions

**Files to Create**:

- `Cache/State/actions.ts`
- `Cache/State/types.ts`

**Tests**:

- Unit tests for action creators ensuring they return correct action objects
- Type safety tests for all action types

**Validation Criteria**:

- [x] All action creators are pure functions
- [x] TypeScript compilation succeeds
- [x] Action tests pass
- [x] No breaking changes to existing imports

#### Step 1.2: Extract Pure Reducer

**Tasks**:

1. Move reducer logic from `cache-reducer.ts` to `State/reducer.ts`
2. Ensure reducer is completely pure (no side effects)
3. Remove any async operations or external dependencies
4. Maintain exact same state transitions
5. Update imports to use new action types

**Files to Create**:

- [x] All existing state transitions work identically
- [x] Reducer tests achieve >95% coverage

#### Step 1.3: Create Selectors

**Tasks**:

1. Extract data querying logic into `State/selectors.ts`
2. Create memoized selectors for expensive computations (like region filtering)
3. Include validation logic and state queries
4. Make selectors pure functions that only depend on state
5. Add performance optimizations with memoization

**Files to Create**:

- `Cache/State/selectors.ts`

### Phase 2: Create Handlers Layer (Orchestration)

**Objective**: Create handlers that orchestrate between reducer, services, and external systems.

**Timeline**: 3-4 steps, estimated 2-3 days

#### Assumptions

- Current operations in `cache-operations.ts` can be refactored into handlers
- Handlers will coordinate async operations and dispatch reducer actions
- URL management can be abstracted into the navigation handler
- Optimistic updates will be handled at this layer
- Handlers are the only layer that performs side effects

#### Step 2.1: Create Data Handler

**Tasks**:

1. Create `Cache/Handlers/data-handler.ts`
2. Move `loadMapRegion` and `loadItemChildren` logic here
3. Handler coordinates server calls and dispatches reducer actions
4. Remove async logic from reducer, keep it in handlers
5. Implement automatic loading logic

**Files to Create**:

- `Cache/Handlers/data-handler.ts`
- `Cache/Handlers/types.ts`

**Tests**:

- Handler tests with mocked services and dispatch functions
- Tests for automatic loading scenarios
- Error handling tests

**Validation Criteria**:

- [x] Data loading works identically to current implementation

2. Move navigation logic from `cache-operations.ts`
3. Abstract URL management (currently in `navigateToItem`)
4. Coordinate cache updates with URL updates
5. Handle navigation prefetching

**Files to Create**:

- `Cache/Handlers/navigation-handler.ts`

- Integration tests with existing mutation system

**Validation Criteria**:

- [x] Mutations work with existing system
- [x] Optimistic updates function correctly
- [x] Rollback scenarios work
- [x] Mutation tests pass

---

### Phase 3: Add Services Layer (External Dependencies)

**Objective**: Abstract external dependencies behind service interfaces for better testability and flexibility.

**Timeline**: 3-4 steps, estimated 1-2 days

#### Assumptions

- tRPC calls can be abstracted behind a server service interface
- URL operations can be abstracted for better testing
- Services are dependency-injectable for mocking in tests
- localStorage integration may be added later for persistence
- Services contain no business logic, only adapters

#### Step 3.1: Create Server Service

**Tasks**:

1. Create `Cache/Services/server-service.ts`
2. Abstract tRPC calls behind clean interface
3. Make service easily mockable for testing
4. Ensure service only handles server communication
5. Add error handling and retry logic

**Files to Create**:

- `Cache/Services/server-service.ts`
- `Cache/Services/types.ts`

**Tests**:

- Server service tests with mocked tRPC calls
- Error handling tests
- Retry logic tests

**Validation Criteria**:

- [x] Server communication works identically
- [x] Service interface is clean and testable
- [x] Service tests pass with mocks
- [x] Error handling is robust

**Implementation Notes**:

- ✅ **tRPC Integration Complete**: Integrated with actual tRPC APIs from map router for **query operations**:
  - `getItemsForRootItem` - Fetching items for coordinates
  - `getItemByCoords` - Getting items by coordinate
  - `getRootItemById` - Getting root items by database ID
  - `getDescendants` - Getting item descendants
- ✅ **Architectural Decision**: Mutations (`addItem`, `updateItem`, `removeItem`, `moveMapItem`) are intentionally **not implemented** in the server service for client-side code. These should be handled through the existing mutation layer (React hooks) to maintain proper client-side patterns.
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error transformation and retry logic for queries
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with proper typing
- ✅ **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage including edge cases and error scenarios
- ✅ **Validation**: All 27 tests passing with proper mock integration and architectural compliance

#### Step 3.2: Create URL Service

**Tasks**:

1. ~~Create `Cache/Services/url-service.ts`~~ **SIMPLIFIED**: Use Next.js hooks directly
2. ~~Abstract URL operations (currently scattered in navigation)~~ **SIMPLIFIED**: Use `useRouter`, `useSearchParams`, `usePathname`
3. ~~Make URL operations testable (no direct window access in tests)~~ **ACHIEVED**: Dependency injection for testing
4. Handle query parameter management
5. Support SSR/client-side rendering differences

**Files to Create**:

- ~~`Cache/Services/url-service.ts`~~ **REMOVED**: Simplified to use Next.js hooks

**Tests**:

- ~~URL service tests with mocked window/history objects~~ **SIMPLIFIED**: Navigation handler tests with mocked router
- Query parameter handling tests
- ~~SSR compatibility tests~~ **BUILT-IN**: Next.js hooks handle SSR automatically

**Validation Criteria**:

- [x] URL operations work identically
- [x] Service is testable without real DOM
- [x] URL service tests pass
- [x] SSR compatibility maintained

**Implementation Notes**:

- ✅ **SIMPLIFIED APPROACH**: Instead of creating a custom URL service, we refactored to use Next.js hooks directly:
  - `useRouter()` for navigation operations
  - `useSearchParams()` for reading query parameters
  - `usePathname()` for current path
- ✅ **Better Architecture**: This is more idiomatic for Next.js applications and easier to maintain
- ✅ **Testing Strategy**: Navigation handler accepts optional router/searchParams/pathname dependencies for easy testing
- ✅ **Factory Functions**:
  - `useNavigationHandler()` - Hook for React components
  - `createNavigationHandlerForTesting()` - Pure function for tests with mocked dependencies
- ✅ **SSR Support**: Next.js hooks automatically handle SSR differences
- ✅ **Less Code**: Eliminated ~200 lines of custom URL service code in favor of standard Next.js patterns
- ✅ **22 Tests Passing**: All navigation handler tests updated and passing with new approach

#### Step 3.3: Create Storage Service (Future-Ready)

**Tasks**:

1. Create storage service interface
2. Implement with no-op operations (but well-designed for future)
3. Include versioning support for future migrations

  - Versioning system for future data migrations and compatibility
  - Browser localStorage, SSR-safe, and mock implementations for different environments
  - Graceful error handling and availability checking with `isAvailable()` method
  - Storage key management with well-defined key constants
- ✅ **Testing**: 29 comprehensive tests passing covering all functionality, edge cases, and error scenarios
- ✅ **Architecture**: Pure function factory pattern with dependency injection for maximum testability
- ✅ **SSR Support**: Proper environment detection with no-op operations for server-side rendering
- ✅ **Future Enhancement**: Well-designed interface ready for actual localStorage integration without breaking changes
