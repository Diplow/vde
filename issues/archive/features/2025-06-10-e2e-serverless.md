# Implement Offline Mode and Convert Tests

Feature: Implement offline mode with localStorage persistence and use it for UI tests

## Feature Understanding

**Request**: Change E2E tests to work without the server running

**Problem Being Solved**: 
- E2E tests currently fail with ECONNREFUSED when server is not running
- Server-based testing is broken and causing consistent failures
- Tests are slow and flaky due to network/database dependencies
- Complex test infrastructure with multiple ports and configurations
- Users cannot work without internet connection (missing offline support)

**Context Analysis**:
- **Product Context**: Developers need reliable, fast tests that can run anywhere without setup. Also, implementing true offline mode would provide real value to users who need to work without connectivity.
- **Technical Context**: E2E tests currently use Playwright to test real user flows against a running Next.js server. The Map Cache has storage service infrastructure but doesn't actively sync to localStorage yet.

**Challenge the Direction - Alternative Approaches**:

1. **Mock at Network Level** (Original request)
   - Pros: No app code changes, realistic testing, easy toggle between modes
   - Cons: Need to maintain mock data, may miss real integration issues

2. **Mock Service Worker (MSW) Integration**
   - Pros: Standard solution, works in both tests and dev, declarative API mocking
   - Cons: Additional dependency, requires app code changes to inject MSW

3. **Separate Test Backend**
   - Pros: Real server behavior, isolated test data, no mocking needed
   - Cons: Still requires server management, slower than mocks, resource intensive

4. **Component Testing Instead**
   - Pros: Faster, more isolated, easier to mock
   - Cons: Doesn't test full user flows, misses integration issues

5. **Cache-Based Testing** (New approach based on your insight!)
   - Pros: Ultra-fast, tests actual cache behavior, simpler setup, tests offline capability
   - Cons: Not true E2E (no server integration), might miss server-specific issues

**Revised Recommendation**: Your cache-based approach is brilliant! Since the Map Cache already handles optimistic updates, we can initialize it with test data and let it handle all interactions. This is more like "UI Integration Testing" than E2E, but it tests what users actually experience - the UI responding to their actions via the cache.

**Assumptions I'm making**:
1. Server-based testing is broken and should be removed entirely
2. These are UI integration tests, not E2E tests
3. Cache-based testing provides sufficient coverage for user interactions
4. Test data should be derived from existing fixtures for consistency
5. Happy path is priority; edge cases can be added incrementally
6. Tests should focus on UI behavior and optimistic updates

**Core Requirements**:
- UI tests must run without any server dependency
- Remove all server-related test code and configuration
- Use cache's optimistic update system for all interactions
- Maintain test coverage for user workflows
- Fast, reliable, deterministic test execution

## Architecture Analysis

**Understanding the Architecture**:

Based on README.md architecture section, the system follows these layers:
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 App Router with progressive enhancement
- **Backend**: tRPC + Next.js API routes  
- **Domain Layer**: DDD in `/src/lib/domains/`
- **Data Layer**: Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL

For E2E tests:
- Tests live in `/tests/e2e/` with Playwright
- Use different ports (3001 for UI, 3002 for CI)
- Tests make real tRPC calls to `/services/api/trpc/*` endpoints
- Authentication handled by better-auth at `/api/auth/*`

**Current State Analysis**:

From examining the test files:
- `api.spec.ts`: Makes direct HTTP calls to tRPC endpoints
- `basic-map-navigation.spec.ts`: Tests UI flows that trigger API calls
- `registration-flow.spec.ts`: Tests auth flow and subsequent API calls
- All tests expect responses in tRPC format: `{ result: { data: { json: ... } } }`

**Outdated Documentation Found**: 
- The E2E README mentions `.env.test` but this file doesn't exist
- Documentation refers to `pnpm test:e2e:install` but package.json doesn't have this script

**Impact Assessment**:
- All E2E test files will be affected by the mocking layer
- Base test fixture needs modification to inject mocks
- No application code changes needed
- Test behavior remains identical

**Technical Constraints**:
- Must match exact tRPC response envelope format
- Need to handle both GET (queries) and POST (mutations) 
- Auth endpoints have different response format than tRPC
- Must preserve test data consistency with seed data

**Risk Assessment**:
- Tests might pass with mocks but fail with real server if mocks drift
- Missing an API call in mocks would cause cryptic failures
- Performance improvements might hide timing issues

## Design Phase

**Revised Solution**: Offline Mode with Cache-Based UI Testing

Implement a true offline mode for the application that uses localStorage as the data source, then use this mode for UI tests. This provides both a valuable user feature and realistic test infrastructure.

**How This Works**:
1. Implement offline mode that loads initial data from localStorage
2. Cache syncs all changes to localStorage (persistence layer)
3. When offline, no server calls are attempted
4. UI tests run in offline mode with pre-populated localStorage
5. Tests verify both UI behavior and offline functionality

**Implementation Architecture**:
1. Add offline mode detection to MapCacheProvider
2. Implement cache ↔ localStorage sync (currently missing)
3. Create test helpers to populate localStorage with test data
4. Configure tests to run in offline mode
5. Mock authentication at context level for offline use

**Implementation Checklist**:

✓ 1. Implement offline mode in MapCacheProvider
   - Add `offlineMode` prop to provider
   - Detect offline mode via navigator.onLine or explicit flag
   - Disable all server calls when offline
   - Load initial data from localStorage instead of server

✓ 2. Implement cache ↔ localStorage sync
   - Add effect to save cache state to localStorage on changes
   - Use existing storage service methods (saveCacheData/loadCacheData)
   - Debounce saves to avoid performance issues
   - Handle expandedItems persistence separately

✓ 3. Create offline mode initialization
   - Add helper to detect and initialize offline mode
   - Create offline auth context that uses localStorage
   - Ensure optimistic updates persist to localStorage
   - Add offline indicator to UI (optional but helpful)

✓ 4. Remove server dependencies from tests
   - Delete port 3002 configuration
   - Remove server startup scripts
   - Clean up CI/server environment variables

✓ 5. Create test infrastructure for offline mode
   - Helper to populate localStorage with test data
   - Helper to clear localStorage between tests
   - Configure tests to run in offline mode
   - Mock auth at context level

✓ 6. Update existing tests for offline/UI focus
   - Remove api.spec.ts (pure API tests)
   - Update navigation tests to verify cache behavior
   - Update registration to use offline auth
   - Focus on UI state changes

✓ 7. Run linter on all modified files

✓ 8. Test offline scenarios
   - Load map from localStorage
   - Create items (persist to localStorage)
   - Navigate between items
   - Verify persistence across page reloads
   
   **Note**: Tests completed but revealed environment configuration issues:
   - Tests require dev server running on port 3000 (defeats serverless purpose)
   - localStorage SecurityError when accessed before page navigation
   - Fixed by navigating to about:blank first
   - All tests currently fail due to missing server dependency
   - Need to revisit serverless approach or improve offline mode implementation

□ 9. Rename test infrastructure
   - Consider keeping `e2e` name but document as "offline UI tests"
   - Update package.json scripts
   - Update test descriptions

□ 10. Update documentation
   - Document offline mode feature
   - Update test README for offline testing
   - Add offline mode to CLAUDE.md
   - Document localStorage data structure

**Test Strategy**:

Happy Path First:
1. Map navigation with cached tiles
2. Create new items (optimistically)
3. Update existing items
4. Move items between positions
5. Complex interactions (expand/collapse)

**Architecture Decisions**:

1. **Offline-First Architecture**: Implement true offline mode as a user feature
2. **localStorage as Truth**: When offline, localStorage is the data source
3. **Cache Sync**: Bidirectional sync between cache and localStorage
4. **Test in Offline Mode**: Tests run the actual offline code path
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Online mode adds server sync on top

**Benefits of This Approach**:
- Provides real offline functionality for users
- Tests the actual offline code paths
- No mock data - uses real localStorage
- Tests are deterministic and fast
- Improves app resilience and user experience

**Additional Benefits**:
- Users can work without internet connection
- Data persists across browser sessions
- Natural disaster recovery (localStorage backup)
- Foundation for future sync features

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- No server integration testing in these tests
- Need to implement localStorage sync (but it's valuable anyway)
- Slightly more complex than pure mocking

**Future Considerations** (not in initial scope):
- Sync queue for offline mutations to replay when online
- Conflict resolution when server data differs from localStorage
- Selective sync (only sync user's own data offline)
- Offline mode indicator in UI

Should I proceed with this offline-first implementation plan?
