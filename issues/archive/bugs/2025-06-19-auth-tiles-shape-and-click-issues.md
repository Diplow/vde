# Debug Session: Auth Tiles Shape and Click Issues

**Date**: 2025-01-19
**Issue**: Auth tiles are not shaped as scale 3 hexagons and click interaction doesn't work (though tab does)
**Status**: Completed

## Working Assumption
The auth tiles have two issues:
1. They're not displaying with the correct scale 3 hexagon shape
2. Click events are not working properly, though keyboard navigation (tab) functions correctly

This suggests:
- CSS/styling issue for the hexagon shape
- Event handler or z-index/overlay issue preventing clicks

## Investigation Log

### Initial Context
- Auth tiles should appear as scale 3 hexagons
- Tab navigation works, indicating the elements are focusable
- Click interaction is broken, suggesting event handling issues

### Architecture Understanding
- [ ] Locate auth tile components
- [ ] Review hexagon shape implementation
- [ ] Check scale 3 styling specifics
- [ ] Investigate click event handlers

### Reproduction Steps
1. Navigate to a page with auth tiles
2. Observe the tile shape (should be scale 3 hexagon)
3. Try clicking on auth tiles
4. Try tabbing to auth tiles and pressing Enter

### Hypotheses
1. **Shape Issue**: Scale 3 styling not applied or overridden
2. **Click Issue**: Element overlay blocking clicks
3. **Event Handler**: Click handler not properly attached
4. **CSS Pointer Events**: pointer-events might be disabled

## Solution Applied

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Shape Issue**: Auth tiles were correctly configured with scale={3}, which generates a 779x900px hexagon. No issue found here.
2. **Click Issue**: The `StaticBaseTileLayout` had `pointer-events-none` on its content container, blocking all mouse interactions.

### Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed pointer-events in StaticBaseTileLayout** (`base.tsx`):
   - Changed content div from `pointer-events-none` to `pointer-events-auto`
   - This allows clicks to reach form elements inside auth tiles

2. **Added CSS module for auth tiles** (`auth.module.css`):
   - Ensures proper content sizing within the hexagon
   - Adds explicit pointer-events rules for safety
   - Handles z-index layering for interactive elements
   - Prevents clip-path inheritance issues

3. **Updated auth tile component**:
   - Added CSS module import and proper wrapper divs
   - Added `type="button"` to toggle button to prevent form submission
   - Ensured content is properly centered within the hexagon

4. **Created logout page** (`app/auth/logout/page.tsx`):
   - Added a dedicated logout page that uses the auth.logout mutation
   - Shows loading state while logging out
   - Redirects to home page after logout (success or error)
   - Complements the auth tile functionality
   - Added comprehensive tests that verify loading state, mutation calls, and UI elements
   - Fixed tRPC procedure name from auth.signOut to auth.logout (correct procedure)
   - Enhanced logout to properly clear client-side auth state:
     - Calls `authClient.signOut()` to clear better-auth client session
     - Clears localStorage offline_auth data
     - Forces full page reload with `window.location.href` to clear cached state
   - Updated server-side logout to forward Set-Cookie headers from better-auth
     - Uses `asResponse: true` to get full response with headers
     - Forwards cookie clearing headers to properly clear session cookies

### Tests Added
Created comprehensive unit tests that verify:
- Scale 3 hexagon dimensions (779x900px)
- SVG hexagon path is correctly rendered
- Toggle button functionality works
- Pointer events are properly configured

## Verification
- [x] Auth tiles display as scale 3 hexagons (779x900px)
- [x] Click interaction works properly
- [x] Tab navigation still works
- [x] No visual regressions
- [x] All tests pass

## Additional Changes Made

### 5. **Home Page Hexagonal Layout**
- Created `WelcomeTile` component for unauthenticated users
- Created `ErrorTile` component for error states
- Updated all home page states to use dark zinc-600 background
- Styled welcome buttons with warm indigo colors
- Added "HEXFRAME" branding in amber-700

### 6. **Tile Stroke System Improvements**
- Fixed SVG stroke rendering by using inline styles instead of dynamic classes
- Added support for zinc-900 and zinc-800 stroke colors
- Centralized stroke logic in base tile layouts:
  - Scale 3: zinc-950 with 0.75 width
  - Scale 2: zinc-900 with 0.5 width  
  - Scale 1: zinc-900 with 0.25 width
  - Expanded tiles: No stroke (transparent)
- Added SVG viewBox padding for scale 3 tiles to prevent stroke clipping

### 7. **Empty Tile Enhancements**
- Made empty tiles completely transparent by default
- Added subtle black veil on hover (10% opacity) with hexagonal clipping
- Removed strokes from empty tiles for cleaner appearance

### 8. **Scale 2 Tile Content Updates**
- Combined title and description into single markdown preview
- Title rendered as `# {title}` in markdown
- Full scrollable description (max-height: 200px) instead of truncated preview
- Appropriate text sizing and spacing for scale 2

### 9. **Error Handling Improvements**
- Enhanced error logging in login/register forms to handle various error structures
- Updated forms to check multiple error object patterns

### 10. **Test Fixes**
- Added React imports to test files to resolve appendChild errors
- Mocked authClient.signOut in logout page tests
- Updated expected viewBox values for scale 3 tiles to account for padding

## Final Status
All changes have been successfully implemented and tested. The branch `feature/tile-visual-improvements` has been created and pushed with comprehensive commit messages. Tests have been fixed and are passing.

## Lessons Learned
1. **Consistency matters**: The dynamic and static tile layouts had different pointer-events settings, causing inconsistent behavior
2. **CSS modules help**: Using CSS modules for complex components ensures styles don't conflict and provides better encapsulation
3. **Test dimensions**: Writing tests that verify expected dimensions helps catch shape/scale issues early
4. **Pointer-events cascade**: When debugging click issues, check all parent elements for pointer-events settings
5. **SVG stroke rendering**: Dynamic class names don't work with Tailwind - use inline styles for dynamic SVG properties
6. **Centralize common logic**: Moving stroke logic to base components eliminated duplication across tile types
