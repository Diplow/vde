# Debug Session: Skeleton Disappears in Offline Mode

## Issue Description
When loading a map in offline mode, the skeleton appears for just a few milliseconds and then disappears. This happens during the E2E tests that are being reworked to use cache-based loading instead of server calls.

## Working Assumption
The skeleton is disappearing because the cache is not properly loading data from localStorage, causing the loading state to complete without any items being displayed. This likely happens because:
1. The cache loads empty initial state
2. The loading skeleton shows briefly
3. The cache tries to load from localStorage but fails or loads empty data
4. The loading completes with no items, removing the skeleton but showing nothing

## Architectural Context
Based on the codebase architecture:
- **Frontend Layer**: Map Cache system (src/app/map/Cache/) handles all data operations
- **Components**: MapCacheProvider wraps the map interface and manages offline mode
- **Loading States**: Canvas component shows skeleton during loading
- The cache has been reworked to handle all data loading, including initialization
- In offline mode, data should load from localStorage instead of server

## Investigation Log

### Step 1: Understanding the Loading Flow
Checked the Canvas component (src/app/map/Canvas/index.tsx):
- Lines 147-150: Shows skeleton if `isLoading && !centerItem`
- This means if `isLoading` is false but there are no items, skeleton disappears

### Step 2: Checking Loading State Management
Checked the cache reducer and provider:
- Initial state has `isLoading: false` (reducer.ts line 13)
- The provider loads from localStorage on mount (provider.tsx lines 99-139)
- But it never sets `isLoading: true` during this process
- The lifecycle hook also doesn't manage loading state properly

### Root Cause Identified
The loading state is never properly managed in offline mode:
1. Cache starts with `isLoading: false`
2. Provider begins loading from localStorage
3. Canvas checks loading state and finds it false
4. Skeleton disappears even though data is still being loaded
5. If localStorage is empty or loading fails, nothing is displayed

The fix is to properly manage loading state during the localStorage loading process.

## Resolution

### Fix Applied
Modified the MapCacheProvider to properly manage loading state:

1. **Initial Loading State** (provider.tsx lines 77-78, 91-92):
   - Set `isLoading: true` when in offline mode with no initial items
   - This ensures the skeleton is shown while localStorage is being loaded

2. **Complete Loading** (provider.tsx lines 138-141, 144-147):
   - Set `isLoading: false` after attempting to load from localStorage
   - Also set to false on error to prevent indefinite loading state

### Why This Works
- The Canvas component checks `isLoading && !centerItem` to show skeleton
- Previously, `isLoading` was always false, so skeleton disappeared immediately
- Now, loading state is properly managed during the async localStorage load
- This gives time for the data to load before removing the skeleton

### Verification
The test output shows "✅ Root tile visible" which confirms:
- The skeleton appeared during loading
- Data was loaded from localStorage
- The skeleton was replaced with actual content

### Side Effects
None - this only affects the loading state management in offline mode.

### Test Status
✅ **Skeleton issue is FIXED** - Test logs confirm:
- Loading skeleton appears with "Loading enhanced features..." message
- Skeleton transitions to actual content once localStorage data loads
- Root tile is visible and interactive

❌ **Expand button issue remains** - This is a separate bug that needs investigation.
