# Refactor Session: optimistic-move.ts Clarity

**Date**: 2025-01-18
**Target**: `src/app/map/Canvas/hooks/_orchestrators/optimistic-move.ts`
**Status**: Pre-Refactoring Analysis

## Pre-Refactoring Analysis

### File Overview
- **Current size**: 391 lines
- **Functions**: 5 functions
- **Main function**: `performOptimisticMove` (85 lines - exceeds 50 line guideline)
- **Purpose**: Handles optimistic updates for moving tiles (both simple moves and swaps)

### Current Concepts

#### Existing Domain Concepts
From mapping domain:
- `Coord` - coordinate system type
- `CoordSystem` - coordinate utilities
- `TileData` - tile data structure
- `CacheState` - cache state type
- `CacheSelectors` - cache selection utilities
- `getColor` - color determination from coordinates

From app/map types:
- `MoveMapItemMutation` - mutation interface for move operations

#### Identified New Concepts

1. **MoveOperation** (implicit)
   - **What**: Distinguishes between simple move (to empty) vs swap (to occupied)
   - **Why**: Different logic paths and optimistic update strategies
   - **Current**: Logic scattered in main function with `isSwap` boolean

2. **OptimisticMoveStrategy** (implicit)
   - **What**: Strategy for applying optimistic updates during move operations
   - **Why**: Different update patterns for moves vs swaps
   - **Current**: Mixed into main function logic

3. **ChildrenMigration** (implicit)
   - **What**: Process of moving children when parent moves
   - **Why**: Maintains hierarchical relationships during moves
   - **Current**: Duplicated logic in both move and swap paths

4. **ServerConfirmation** (implicit)
   - **What**: Process of confirming optimistic updates with server response
   - **Why**: Ensures eventual consistency
   - **Current**: Complex logic in `confirmServerUpdate` function

5. **RollbackHandler** (implicit)
   - **What**: Captures and restores state on failure
   - **Why**: Provides reliable error recovery
   - **Current**: Simple state capture with spread operator

### Rule of 6 Violations

1. **Main function too long**: `performOptimisticMove` is 85 lines (should be max 50)
2. **updateOptimisticSwap** has 6+ parameters (including accessed closures)
3. **confirmServerUpdate** handles complex parsing logic mixed with update logic
4. **Duplicated children update logic** between move and swap paths

### Clarity Issues

1. **Mixed abstraction levels**: Server calls mixed with optimistic update logic
2. **Unclear separation**: Move vs swap logic intertwined
3. **Complex conditional flow**: isSwap boolean controls major branching
4. **Duplicated patterns**: Children update logic repeated with slight variations
5. **Long parameter lists**: Functions depend on many parameters and closures

### Proposed Structure

Following the Rule of 6 and similar to optimistic-swap refactoring:

```
optimistic-move/
├── types.ts              # Shared interfaces and types
├── move-detector.ts      # Detect move vs swap operations
├── move-operation.ts     # Execute simple move operations
├── children-migration.ts # Migrate children during moves (reusable)
├── server-sync.ts        # Confirm server updates
└── index.ts             # Main orchestrator
```

### Questions for Validation

1. Should we reuse the `OptimisticUpdateRollback` pattern from optimistic-swap?
2. Is the distinction between move and swap operations clear and useful?
3. Should children migration be a shared utility since it's used by both move and swap?
4. Should server confirmation logic be generalized for all optimistic operations?

## User Validation

**User confirmed all proposals**:
1. ✅ Reuse OptimisticUpdateRollback pattern from optimistic-swap
2. ✅ Move vs swap distinction is useful
3. ✅ Children migration should be a shared utility
4. ✅ Server confirmation should be generalized
5. ✅ Update Canvas README with new concepts

## Refactoring Execution

## Post-Refactoring Summary

### Changes Applied

1. **Structural Reorganization**:
   - Created new folder structure: `_orchestrators/optimistic-move/`
   - Split 391-line file into 6 focused modules
   - Each module follows single responsibility principle

2. **Files Created**:
   - `types.ts` (49 lines) - Shared interfaces and type definitions
   - `move-detector.ts` (47 lines) - Operation type detection and validation
   - `move-operation.ts` (68 lines) - Simple move execution logic
   - `children-migration.ts` (116 lines) - Reusable children migration strategy
   - `swap-handler.ts` (66 lines) - Adapter to reuse optimistic-swap
   - `server-sync.ts` (108 lines) - Server response synchronization
   - `index.ts` (161 lines) - Main orchestration
   - Original file now just re-exports (5 lines)

3. **Clarity Improvements**:
   - Clear separation between move and swap operations
   - Reused OptimisticUpdateRollback pattern from optimistic-swap
   - Children migration extracted as shared utility
   - Server sync generalized for move operations
   - Consistent error handling and logging

### Concepts Introduced

1. **MoveOperation** - Explicit type for move vs swap detection
2. **ChildrenMigrationStrategy** - Reusable pattern for migrating children
3. **SwapHandler** - Adapter pattern to reuse existing swap logic
4. **ServerSynchronizer (Move)** - Specialized sync for move operations

All concepts documented in `src/app/map/Canvas/README.md`

### Before/After Metrics

**Before**:
- 1 file with 391 lines
- 5 functions, main function 85 lines
- Mixed concerns and abstraction levels
- Duplicated children update logic

**After**:
- 8 files (including re-export)
- Largest file 161 lines (orchestrator)
- 15 focused functions across modules
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reusable patterns extracted
- Leverages existing optimistic-swap for consistency

### Key Improvements

1. **Reusability**: 
   - Children migration can be used by both move and swap
   - Leverages existing OptimisticUpdateRollback pattern
   - Reuses optimistic-swap for swap operations

2. **Clarity**:
   - Operation type detection is explicit
   - Each module has a single, clear purpose
   - Function names clearly express intent

3. **Maintainability**:
   - Easier to test individual components
   - Changes to move logic don't affect swap logic
   - Server sync can be enhanced independently

### Integration Points

1. **With optimistic-swap**:
   - Reuses rollback-handler for consistency
   - Delegates swap operations entirely
   - Shares similar structure and patterns

2. **With drag-and-drop**:
   - performOptimisticMove remains the main entry point
   - API unchanged for backward compatibility
   - Enhanced with better error messages

### Future Considerations

1. **Unify Server Sync**:
   - Could create a general server-sync utility
   - Share between move, swap, and future operations

2. **Enhanced Validation**:
   - Add more move validation rules
   - Check for circular parent references
   - Validate depth limits

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Batch children updates
   - Optimize large subtree moves
   - Add progress callbacks for long operations

### Verification

- ✅ Linter passes with no errors
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ All Canvas hooks tests passing (18 tests)
- ✅ Domain concepts documented in Canvas README
- ✅ Original functionality preserved through re-exports
