# MapItemActions Modularization Refactoring

**Date**: 2025-01-18
**Status**: Completed

## Overview
Refactored the complex `MapItemActions` class to improve clarity and maintainability by extracting move-related logic into specialized modules.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Modular Structure
Created `/src/lib/domains/mapping/_actions/map-item-actions/` directory with:
- `index.ts` - Main MapItemActions class (thin facade)
- `move-orchestrator.ts` - High-level move coordination logic
- `validation-strategy.ts` - Move validation rules

### 2. Extracted Complex Logic
- **MoveOrchestrator**: Handles the 3-step move sequence with clear method names
- **ValidationStrategy**: Centralizes validation rules for moves
- Removed all console.log statements
- Split the 200-line moveMapItem method into smaller, focused functions

### 3. Maintained Backward Compatibility
- Updated `/src/lib/domains/mapping/_actions/index.ts` to export from new location
- All existing tests pass without modification
- API remains unchanged

## Benefits
1. **Improved Clarity**: Each module has a single, clear responsibility
2. **Better Testability**: Smaller functions are easier to test in isolation
3. **Reduced Complexity**: The main moveMapItem logic is now split across multiple well-named methods
4. **Follows Rule of 6**: Each file contains max 6 functions, functions are under 50 lines

## Test Results
- All unit tests pass ✓
- All integration tests pass ✓
- Type checking passes ✓

## Future Improvements
Consider further modularization of:
- Creation helpers
- Query helpers
- Movement helpers

These could follow the same pattern established in this refactoring.
